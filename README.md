# hello-world
First learning project work
I've installed atom editor for html5 because my old favorite, bluefish, has a bug with keeping track of the line where the cursor is.
Apparently, if I don't use GIT with Atom, I'm mission out a some very nice version control functionality. I'll try to learn.
I added this line on Oct 8
I''m not using ATOM anymore. For vague reasons, I think I like CODE better.
